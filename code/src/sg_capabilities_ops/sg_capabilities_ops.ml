(* [union a b] is the dual of [mask]: a capability is granted in the result if [a] OR [b] grants it.
   Where [mask] is the exact greatest lower bound, [union] is a sound *upper* bound (it grants at
   least everything each parent does): booleans are OR'd, an object is present when either side has
   it, and list scopes are set-unioned -- with [None] / ["*"] ("all") absorbing.  Negations are kept
   glob-aware (a side's negation survives only where the other side grants nothing it denies), so
   [union] is *exact* whenever the join is representable as a prefix-glob allow-list.  It can still
   over-grant in the irreducible cases where the join is a cone minus a sub-cone with a point
   re-granted inside -- a shape the flat allow-list cannot express (that would need a decision-tree
   capability form).  The result is re-normalized so its allow-lists are canonical.

   [union] is commutative and idempotent, and [make ()] is its identity, but it is NOT associative:
   because the irreducible over-grant above is order-dependent, [(a ∪ b) ∪ c] can differ from
   [a ∪ (b ∪ c)] once a negation meets a positive that partially refills its cone (see the
   [union_not_associative_negations] test).  It IS associative over negation-free operands, where it
   degenerates to exact set-union (see [prop_union_associative_positive]).  Callers that fold [union]
   (e.g. [Sgs_caps_rules.eval]) therefore get an order-dependent -- but always sound -- result. *)
