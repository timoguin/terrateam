    This revokes {i visibility} only, which does take effect immediately — {!enforce_user}, and so
    every tenant-scoped endpoint, consults the membership table on each request. But the user's
    capabilities may still name the tenant, and those are what every user-facing API reports as
    their role and what an access token is minted from. The caller must pair this with
    {!Sgs_user.revoke_tenant} in the same transaction, and must let that call's failure abort the
    transaction rather than proceeding — the half-applied state is the one that still authorizes. *)

    by any coverage. Used to refuse the removal or demotion that would leave a tenant with nobody
    able to administer it.

    Locks the tenant row ([FOR UPDATE]) to avoid races. *)
val count_admins : 'a t -> Pgsql_io.t -> (int, [> err ]) result Abb.Future.t

(** [rename ~name t db] renames the tenant.

    [name] is trimmed, and must be non-blank and at most {!max_name_length} characters. It must not
    collide with another tenant's name: [tenants.name] carries no unique index, but
    {!find_or_create} resolves tenants by name, so a duplicate would make that lookup ambiguous. The
    existence check and the update run under a row lock. *)
