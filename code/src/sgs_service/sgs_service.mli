(** A service: a part of the server with a lifetime of its own around the HTTP listener and routes
    of its own. The core starts each service of the build before the listener, appends its routes to
    the shared route table, and stops it after the listener. An edition is a choice of services, and
    a service that exists in several editions is built by a functor over what differs. *)

(** One route-table entry: the HTTP method and the route with its handler. *)
type route = Brtl_rtng.Method.t * Brtl_rtng.Handler.t Brtl_rtng.Route.Route.t

(** Why a service refuses to start, told to the operator: the server logs it and exits. *)

module type S = sig
  (** The running service. *)
  type t

  (** The service's name. *)
  val name : string

  (** Start the service before the listener, or refuse to. *)
  val start : Sgs_config.t -> Sgs_storage.t -> (t, start_err) result Abb.Future.t

  (** The routes appended to the shared route table. *)
  val routes : t -> Sgs_config.t -> Sgs_storage.t -> route list

  (** Stop the service after the listener. *)

(** A started service together with its module, so a list can hold services of different types. *)

(** Start the service and pair it with its module. *)
