(** [revoke_login_sessions ?except user db] deletes every browser login session ([kind = 'login']
    row in [access_tokens]) the user holds, forcing a fresh sign-in. A login session snapshots the
    capabilities at sign-in, so any capability change makes the snapshot stale — {!grant_tenant} and
    {!revoke_tenant} call this themselves; callers that write [users.capabilities] directly must
    call it in the same transaction. API tokens are deliberately untouched: capabilities limit what
    tokens a user can create, not what an already-minted token can do.

    [except] keeps one login row, by id. Pass it only for a strictly widening change: the kept
    snapshot is then merely under-privileged until the next sign-in, and the acting user is not
    logged out mid-request for a change that only gave them something. *)

(** [grant_tenant ~grants ~tenant_id user db] adds [tenant_id] to each of the user's named
    tenant-scoped capabilities, creating one scoped to that tenant alone when absent, and returns
    the stored result.

    The row is locked for the read-modify-write, so this must run inside a transaction — together
    with the matching {!Sgs_tenant.add_user}. Membership and capability are the two halves of one
    authorization decision and must not drift.

    [except_login_session] is forwarded to {!revoke_login_sessions}: pass the acting user's own
    login-session id so the widening grant does not log them out. *)

(** [revoke_tenant ~grants ~tenant_id user db] takes [tenant_id] out of each of the user's named
    tenant-scoped capabilities. A scope holds a refusal as readily as an allowance, so this always
    succeeds: taking one tenant out of an installation-wide grant leaves every other tenant in it.

    That is more than a tenant-scoped endpoint may ask for. Narrowing a grant that covers more than
    the tenant in hand rewrites authority the caller does not own, and demotes an installation
    administrator without the guard that keeps the last one — so the membership endpoints refuse it
    first, on {!Sgs_tenant_members_common.wider_grant}.

    There is deliberately no [except_login_session] escape hatch here, unlike {!grant_tenant}: the
    kept session would go on authorizing the right this call just took away. A caller revoking a
    right from themselves is logged out so that the revokation is visibly immediate. *)

    afterwards.

    Answers [`Would_remove_last_instance_admin_err] when [target_user_id] holds the only
    unrestricted grant, and [`Not_found_user_err] when no active user has that id. Only the
    unrestricted grant counts, on both sides: a tenant-scoped admin is not what is being protected.

    [f] runs inside the guard's transaction, holding the lock that serializes installation-admin
    mutations, so that the count and the write it authorizes cannot be separated — without it two
    demotions of two different administrators each read the other as their replacement and both
    commit, leaving zero. See [sql/lock_instance_admins.sql]. That transaction is this function's
    own: it must not be called from inside another, which {!Pgsql_io.tx} answers by raising. *)

(** [set_instance_admin admin ~f db target_user_id] writes [admin] to [target_user_id] and then runs
    [f] in the same transaction, so a caller writing more than the grant lands all of it or none of
    it, and reads the grant back through anything [f] does.

    [`Instance_admin] writes the unrestricted [admin] scope, replacing a tenant-scoped one.
    [`No_admin] clears the [admin] scope only when it is unrestricted: a tenant-scoped grant is left
    as it is, and on a user who holds no grant the write changes nothing.

    When the write changes either capability column, both are written and every login session the
    target holds is revoked (see {!revoke_login_sessions}). When it changes nothing, nothing is
    written and no session is revoked. Answers [`Not_found_user_err] when no active user has that
    id.

    The transaction is this function's own on both paths, so like {!guard_last_instance_admin} it
    must not be called from inside another one. *)
