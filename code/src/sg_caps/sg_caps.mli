(** What a user or a token is allowed to do.

    This replaces the capability record read from JSON ([Sgs_session_caps_capabilities]): every
    scope is a set of strings ({!Sg_caps_trie_scope}) instead of a list of glob patterns, so that
    {!union} and {!inter} are exact -- they allow exactly what their operands allow between them, or
    in common.

    A capability that reaches nothing is a capability that is not there: there is no option around a
    scope, and {!empty} allows nothing at all.

    An [admin] grant authorizes preview and commit over the tenants it names, whether or not the
    [commit] or [preview] scopes reach them. The two are kept apart in [t], so that taking a tenant
    out of [admin] also takes away the preview and commit it implied; {!authorizes} is where the two
    are read together. *)
