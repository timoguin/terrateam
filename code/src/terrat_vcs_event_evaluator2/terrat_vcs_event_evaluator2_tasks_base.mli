      of one commit is not stored, or the config builder is on and the config of [to_ref] is not
      built yet.

      A commit can move while a run operates, and only a change to the files of a dirspace makes the
      run stale (RFD 2356). [missing_tree] says what to do with a tree that is not stored. With
      [`Fetch], and the tree builder off, the tree is read from the forge and stored. With
      [`Unknown], or with the tree builder on, the answer is [None]. The call never waits for a tree
      build or a config build: a caller that must answer now gets [None] instead. *)

      completed when the run finishes. *)

  (** Create the completed [terrateam apply] commit check at the head of the pull request.

      A pull request that reached a noop still has to be mergeable, thus an operator who needs that
      check green to merge gets it even though no work was done. The caller decides that no work is
      left; this reads no matches of its own, so a caller that must not start a setup job can use
      it. *)

  (** [forward_std_keys s store] adds to [store] the values of the standard keys that the build of
      [s] computed, so that the next eval does not compute them again. An eval starts from the store
      it was made with, thus a value it does not get is computed again.

      A key is standard when it holds the same value for the whole of one event:
      - It is a function of a commit sha or of an account, and not of a branch name. The ref of a
        branch can move while a job operates, thus [branch_ref], [dest_branch_ref] and all that
        comes from them are not standard.
      - The evaluation does not write it. [commit_checks] and [work_manifests_for_job] change when
        the evaluation writes, thus they are not standard.
      - The forge does not change it during the event. The mergeable state of a pull request can
        change, thus it has a key of its own.

      The pull request is standard: an event reads it once. A caller that must know the head of a
      branch at a later time reads the forge again. [client] is not standard, because it is a handle
      and not a value. *)
