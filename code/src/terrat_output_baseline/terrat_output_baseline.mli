(** Finds the outputs that an [outputs:] term of a [depends_on] compares against.

    The baseline of a dirspace is the outputs of its most recent successful apply in another pull
    request of the same repository. That apply is what represents the infrastructure now, so a
    dependent only needs to run if the current apply changed an output relative to it. The applies
    of the pull request under evaluation are excluded, so a second apply in the same pull request is
    still compared against the other pull request. *)

(** The apply step that recorded the outputs, and the outputs. [step] tells the layout of [outputs],
    for example [tf/apply] or [custom/apply]. [outputs] is [None] when the step recorded no

(** The baseline of [dirspace] for [pull_request] in [repo], or [None] if no other pull request has
    applied [dirspace] successfully. [repo] and [pull_request] are the ids of the VCS-neutral
    tables.

    When [pull_request] has applied [dirspace], the baseline is older than its most recent apply.
    Thus an apply in another pull request after that apply does not change the baseline, and the
    dependents that were pruned stay pruned. *)
