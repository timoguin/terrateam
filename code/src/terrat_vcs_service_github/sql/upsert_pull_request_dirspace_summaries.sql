-- Store the state of each named dirspace of the pull request of the context at
-- the head $sha (RFD 2356), and mark the unified summary comment dirty when a
-- state changed, thus the next drain shows it.  Each store is a new decision
-- about the head, thus updated_at moves even when the state stays the same.
-- $work_manifest is the run whose result decided the states, or null.
