-- The most recent successful run of each named dirspace of the context, once for a plan and once
-- for an apply, with the sha of the run and the time of its work manifest.  Also whether the most
-- recent plan and the most recent apply failed: a push makes a new head with no checks, and the
-- check of a failed run is written again on the new head (RFD 2356).
--
-- Unlike select_dirspace_applies_for_context.sql, this does not test the sha of the work manifest
-- against the sha of the branch.  Whether a run still counts is a question about the hashes of
-- the files of that dirspace, and the caller answers it, thus this query gives the sha of the run
-- and lets the caller decide.  The time is what puts the runs of the layers in order.  The heads
-- at the start and at the result of a run are the pairs of commits that moved while it operated
-- (RFD 2356); the views do not carry them, thus they come from work_manifests.
