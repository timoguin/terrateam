(* Tests for how dirspaceflows are partitioned into batches, where each batch becomes its own work
   manifest.

   The invariants a batch must satisfy:

   1. All dirspaceflows in a batch agree on (environment, runs_on).

   2. No batch contains two dirspaceflows in the same dir.

   3. No batch is larger than max_workspaces_per_batch.

   And, as much as the above allows, batches should be as large as possible: a user setting
   max_workspaces_per_batch should get batches of that size. *)
