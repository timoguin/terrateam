(* The rule that decides which dirspaces run now, and whether the evaluator
   starts another round on its own.

   These are the two halves of a tree of runs (RFD 2305).  A run used to be a
   fixed list of layers, so a dirspace waited for every dirspace of the layer in
   front of it whether it depended on it or not.  Now the run that remains is
   put into layers again on every evaluation, so a dirspace waits for the
   dirspaces it depends on and for nothing else.

   The fixtures here are the system-test fixtures, built in OCaml so the whole
   sequence can be walked without a repository, a database or a VCS. *)
