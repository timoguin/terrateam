(* The capabilities of a compute node live in a jsonb column, and RFD 2094 adds a
   field to them in more than one phase.  No phase writes a migration for that
   column.  A row that an earlier version of the server wrote must therefore
   still decode, with each field it has no value for at its default.

   This matters more than it looks.  [to_capabilities] in each provider turns a
   decode error into no node at all, and [Ret.u] turns that into [`Bad_result],
   which fails the whole query.  Every read of that node then fails, and the work
   manifest of the node waits for ever. *)
